# RWAi — Sovereign AI Agents for Real World Assets on Mantle

> **Track:** AI & RWA Track · Turing Test Hackathon  
> **One-liner:** The first RWA platform where 4 ERC-8004 sovereign AI agents tokenize assets, manage portfolios, and answer to no one — every decision benchmarked on Mantle forever.

---

## The Problem

**1. Tokenizing a real-world asset costs $100,000 and takes months.**  
Lawyers, Solidity developers, compliance consultants — before a single token exists. Only institutions can afford this. Retail asset owners are locked out entirely.

**2. Mantle's native RWA ecosystem (USDY, mETH, fBTC, mUSD) has no intelligent layer.**  
The assets are excellent. The yield is real. But there is no system that tells a retail investor *what* to buy, *how much*, and *when to rebalance* — based on their risk profile, on current data, on their actual wallet.

**3. On-chain AI has a trust crisis.**  
AI agents are executing decisions that move real money — but there is no verifiable identity, no reputation trail, no auditable record of who decided what and why. When an AI agent acts, it leaves no proof it ever existed.

---

## The Solution

**RWAi** puts four ERC-8004 sovereign AI agents to work on these three problems simultaneously.

```
Asset Owner                          Investor
     │                                   │
     ▼                                   ▼
[Upload PDF/DOCX]              [Tell Atlas what you want]
     │                          (text or VOICE command)
     ▼                                   │
[NEXUS analyzes doc]           [ATLAS builds strategy]
[SHIELD validates compliance]  [YIELD prices the assets]
     │                                   │
     ▼                                   ▼
[ERC-20 deployed on Mantle]    [Allocation executed on Mantle]
     │                                   │
     └──────────────┬────────────────────┘
                    ▼
        AgentExecutor.sol — immutable on-chain log
        Every decision. Every agent. Every outcome.
        Permanently benchmarked on Mantle.
```

**For asset owners:** Upload a PDF deed or income statement → Nexus extracts asset metadata, Yield prices it, Shield scores compliance → ERC-20 token deployed on Mantle in minutes. Cost: gas only.

**For investors:** Talk to Atlas (text or voice) → Atlas coordinates Nexus + Shield + Yield → recommends a strategy across real Mantle RWAs → executes allocation → writes reasoning on-chain with its ERC-8004 identity as proof.

**For everyone:** Every AI decision is logged immutably in `AgentExecutor.sol`. Every agent action is signed by its ERC-8004 identity NFT. Reputation score (0–100) gates autonomy level. This is the first verifiable AI performance benchmark on Mantle.

---

## Why This Wins the Turing Test

The three defining criteria of this hackathon — built into RWAi's core:

| Hackathon Criterion | How RWAi Delivers |
|---|---|
| **On-chain benchmarking of AI** | `AgentExecutor.sol` logs every agent decision on Mantle — queryable, permanent, the first RWA AI benchmark on-chain |
| **ERC-8004 agent identity** | 4 agents registered (nexus=41, shield=42, yield=43, atlas=44), reputation gating live, reputation mirrors to ERC-8004 on-chain |
| **Radical transparency** | Atlas voice interface — watch the agent hear your command, reason, execute, and write proof to Mantle in real time |

---

## The 4 ERC-8004 Agents

| Agent | ERC-8004 ID | Role | Primary On-Chain Action |
|-------|------------|------|------------------------|
| **Nexus** | 41 | Tokenizes RWAs from documents | `AgentExecutor.logTokenization()` |
| **Shield** | 42 | AI compliance review — KYC/AML, sanctions, risk scoring | `AgentExecutor.logComplianceReview()` |
| **Yield** | 43 | Prices assets via Pyth, monitors APY across Mantle RWAs | `YieldOracle.updatePrice()` / `createMarketSnapshot()` |
| **Atlas** | 44 | Portfolio strategy, voice commands, autonomous execution | `AgentExecutor.executeAllocation()` / `executeRebalance()` |

**Reputation scores (live on Mantle Sepolia):** Nexus: 85 · Shield: 75 · Yield: 75 · Atlas: 75  
Higher reputation → more autonomous actions permitted. Agents earn reputation through successful on-chain decisions.

**Agent runtime:** OpenClaw/CMDOP primary → Groq (llama-3.3-70b) → Claude fallback. Model-agnostic, 4-level chain.

## Autonomous Agent Control — HybridVault + EIP-712 Capped Consent

This is the feature that separates RWAi from every other "AI + RWA" project: **Atlas does not just recommend — it executes.**

Most AI portfolio tools give advice. Atlas acts. But acting with someone's money requires trust. RWAi solves this with **capped consent** — a single EIP-712 signature that gives Atlas a bounded, revocable allowance to operate autonomously.

```
User signs once (EIP-712)
  └─ "Atlas may move up to $500 from my HybridVault"

Atlas detects opportunity → executes rebalance autonomously
  └─ No per-transaction approvals needed within the cap

Every autonomous action is logged on AgentExecutor.sol
  └─ ERC-8004 identity of Atlas is the signer — permanent proof

Allowance exhausted → Atlas requests new consent
  └─ User is always in control of the ceiling
```

**Why this matters for the scoring criteria:**

- *AI × RWA depth* — AI is the execution layer, not a chatbot. Atlas signs and submits transactions.
- *Mantle integration* — HybridVault.sol lives on Mantle. Every autonomous action is an on-chain event.
- *Path B Application* — this is what "AI-driven RWA application" means: an agent that lowers the barrier by acting on the user's behalf, within explicit consent bounds.

**How consent works (EIP-712):**

```typescript
// User signs this structure — no private key exposure, no full custody
{
  domain: { name: "RWAi HybridVault", chainId: 5003 },
  types:  { AgentConsent: [
    { name: "agent",      type: "address" },  // Atlas wallet
    { name: "allowance",  type: "uint256" },  // cap in wei
    { name: "deadline",   type: "uint256" },  // expiry
    { name: "nonce",      type: "uint256" },  // replay protection
  ]},
  message: { agent, allowance, deadline, nonce }
}
```

The signature is submitted to `HybridVault.relayAllowance()`. From that point, Atlas can call `HybridVault.agentExecute()` for actions up to the cap — each deducting from the allowance, each logged permanently on `AgentExecutor.sol`.

## Scoring Alignment

**General (60%)**
- *AI × RWA depth*: AI is not a chatbot — it's the execution layer. Every tokenization, every allocation, every rebalance is an AI agent action with on-chain proof.
- *Technical completeness*: 8 contracts, 4 agents, full tokenize + market + portfolio flows, voice interface — end-to-end.
- *Mantle integration*: ERC-8004, AgentExecutor, YieldOracle with Pyth, HybridVault with EIP-712 consent, 4 mock RWA tokens.
- *Compliance awareness*: Shield agent scores every asset. ComplianceLog.sol records every decision on-chain.

**Track-specific (40%) — Path A + B**
- *Infrastructure*: Complete tokenization flow — document in, ERC-20 out, compliance logged, price set.
- *Application*: Atlas voice interface — retail investors speak their intent, agent executes, on-chain proof returned.
